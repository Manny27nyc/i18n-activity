<h1 id="title">Internationalization (I18n)  Working Group Charter</h1>

<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization
 Working Group</a>, part of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization Activity</a>, is
to enable universal access to the World Wide Web by proposing and coordinating
the adoption by the W3C of techniques, conventions, technologies, and designs
that enable and enhance the use of W3C technology and the Web worldwide, with
and between the various different languages, scripts, regions, and cultures.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Technical issues related to internationalization and universal access
    across the globe. The Working Group provides advice and assistance related
    to internationalization and encompassing work related to international,
    linguistic, cultural, and writing system variations affecting W3C
    technologies. This advice should be provided to W3C Working Groups as early
    as possible in the development of specifications. The Working Group also
    tracks developments outside the W3C which have a bearing on the
    international Web, such as Unicode, IDN/ICANN issues, language tag and IRI
    developments at the IETF, JavaScript, etc .</li>
  <li>Reviews and discussion of W3C technologies for internationalization issues, as these
    technologies develop. This encompasses a broad array of cultural,
    linguistic, technical and accessibility concerns. Review work may also
    include standards created by external standards bodies and organizations
    related to internationalization, if it is thought to be relevant to W3C
    technology. The Working Group maintains liaison relationships with these
    groups to ensure coordinated, consistent development of these
  standards.</li>
  <li>Outreach and inreach, in the forms of notes, articles, tutorials,
    presentations, tests and other resources to help specification writers, web
    masters, content authors, and others involved in developing and
    implementing the Web understand the issues involved and the techniques
    available with regard to supporting international use of Web technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Two implementations of the Encoding specification during CR.</li>
  <li>Successfully complete reviews and provide assistance in a timely
  manner.</li>
  <li>Maintain good levels of feedback for outreach materials.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<h4>Recommendation-track specifications</h4>

<p>Most of the formal documents produced by the Working Group are guidelines, best practices, requirements, and the like. These are best published as Working Group Notes. </p>
<p>The Working Group will also deliver the following W3C Recommendation:
<dl>
<dt>Encoding</dt>
<dd>
  Implementations have not always implemented encodings for the web platform in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can become more interoperable.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Reviews and advice</h4>

<p>Review of specifications of other W3C Working Groups for issues related to
internationalization, global usage, and cultural sensitivity is an essential
deliverable of the Internationalization  Working Group. This is not a
time-bound activity and the exact schedule of these reviews depends on the
progress of other Working Groups and the availability of resources in the
Internationalization Working Group. There is usually a regular supply of
review work to be done. In depth reviews are typically done at Last Call,
however additional early reviews are particularly useful and will be scheduled
where possible. Review work leads to the raising and tracking of issues related to a technology. Discussions related to these issues are often much more time-consuming than the review itself.</p>
<p>In addition to discussions arising from reviews, the Working Group is often called upon to support other Working Groups with adhoc advice and discussion.</p>

<h4>Web internationalization resources</h4>

<p>The Working Group is being chartered to operate under the Patent Policy to allow it to take  documents to Recommendation status when the need arises.</p>
<p>The WG will continue  to publish resources on the
<a href="/International/">Internationalization Activity</a>
site to assist users of W3C and related Web technologies to internationalize
their applications, content, and services. These will include <a href="/International/articlelist">articles,
notes and reference pages</a> and <a
href="/International/tutorials/">tutorials</a>. </p>

<p>The Working Group will also maintain the Internationalization Activity Web
presence, and develop and maintain ways for users of its resources to quickly
find the material they need, through a variety of means, including topic-based
and task-based indexing.</p>
<p>The WG will also provide internationalization-related best
  practices for users of Web technologies. These documents make the information
  available in a task based fashion, and are accessed by higher level web pages,
  targeted at specific user types and activities, that group together and link to
  all relevant information in summary form, with an organization that aids their
  use.</p>
<p>In the previous charter period the  WG  supported a Japanese Layout task force in their preparation of the document Requirements for Japanese Text Layout. The WG will look for opportunities to replicate the success of this initiative by assisting other groups of people to generate requirements for local support.</p>
<h4>Internationalization tests</h4>

<p>The WG will build on the <a
href="/International/tests/">existing foundation</a> to create
additional test pages and  summaries of results for the support of internationalization-related features in major browsers. The tests will be made available through the W3C Test Framework. These tests
explore support by user agents for internationalization related features, but
also serve an educational role. In addition to their support for techniques documents and articles, these tests are being used by content authors. In addition, other
W3C WGs have incorporated these tests into their own test suites, and user
agent development teams from all the major browsers have used these tests for
identifying, fixing or enhancing internationalization features or bugs in their browsers.</p>

<h4>Outreach activities</h4>

<p>The WG will seek to regularly present knowledge developed by the WG at
conferences and meetings where Web internationalization topics are relevant,
and to maintain a presence in internationalization and localization related
publications. It will also seek out key opportunities to present the
internationalization message to content authors and implementers, and to
encourage the provision of requirements for internationalization of W3C
technologies by in-country experts.</p>

<p>Other WG deliverables are produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the
  charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the working group and
  schedule information cannot be determined in far in advance, but are driven by
  the needs of the Web community.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> W3C Working Groups</dt>
    <dd>The I18n  WG will work with all W3C Working Groups to ensure that
      their deliverables support international use. The list includes the WGs
      in the following Activities, in particular, but is not limited to them: 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Activity">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/rwc/">Rich Web Client</a>: HTML is one of the main formats for
          storing and delivering information on the Web. The I18N  WG will
          help the HTML WG keep HTML  language- and culture-neutral,
          and to make the international components of HTML broadly
        available. The APIs being developed by the Web Apps WG also touch on international issues.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/">Style (CSS)</a>: Formatting varies widely in different cultures, and different
          writing systems need different stylesheet support. The I18N  WG
          will help these working groups address international formatting needs
          by providing requirements, proposals, and advice.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>: XML is the base format for many Web
          applications. The I18N  WG will help the XML CG and the various
          XML WGs to create and ensure an appropriate base for the
          internationalization needs of these applications.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Web Initiative</a>: The I18N  WG will
          monitor the work of the Mobile Web Initiative, to ensure their
          specifications and best practices are internationalized, and to
          integrate their best practices in internationalization
          deliverables.</li>
        <li><a href="/Voice/">Voice Browser</a>, and <a
          href="/2002/mmi/">Multimodal Interaction</a>: Spoken language has
          different requirements from written forms of a language, raising
          internationalization issues that have to be carefully considered.
          Also, new forms of interaction, such as cross-language interaction
          (e.g. a speaker responding with the French pronunciation of a name to
          an English prompt), need to be reviewed with respect to
          internationalization.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>: I18N  will collaborate to
          make sure that Semantic Web technologies are appropriately
          internationalized, and help with creating guidance for the Multilingual Semantic Web.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Other Groups</dt>
    <dd>From time to time, the work of the Internationalization Working Group will be dependent on developments in groups outside the W3C. For example, specifications at the Unicode Consortium, or work on IRIs or language tags at the IETF, etc.</dd> 
</dl>

<h3>Closely related WGs</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/"
 >Internationalization Interest Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The I18n  WG maintains close contact with the I18N IG (charter).
    Resources produced by this WG will be submitted to the I18N IG mailing
    list for review. When needed to assure a broader base for decisions,
    technical topics may be submitted to the I18N IG mailing list for
    discussion. The I18N IG mailing list will also be used for sharing
    information about the work of this WG, sending out information about the
    progress of this WG at regular intervals, and soliciting feedback in
    general. Members of this WG are expected to also become members of the
    I18N IG to assure a smooth flow of information.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/">MultilingualWeb-LT Working Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The I18n  WG will track the work of the MultilingualWeb-LT WG (charter), since it is focused on an important aspect of Web internationalization. The MultilingualWeb-LT WG is also in the Internationalization Activity.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/International/its/ig/">ITS Interest Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The I18n  WG will maintain close contact with the ITS IG (charter).
    Members of the ITS IG may collaborate with the  WG to publish pages
    on the Web site, and the  WG will provide assistance to the ITS WG
    for the development of techniques documents, eg. editorial guidance,
    templates and the like.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/WAI/">WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) </a></dt>
  <dd>The I18N  WG will coordinate with the relevant WAI groups on the
    following points:
    <ul>
      <li>Procedural coordination: Both the I18N  WG and WAI are
        reviewing W3C specifications.</li>
      <li>Technical coordination: There are parallels between the cultural
        universality at the base of the Internationalization work and the
        principle of universal access at the base of the WAI work. Common
        issues resulting from such parallels should be coordinated.</li>
      <li>Internationalization review of WAI work, and WAI review of work of
        the I18N  WG: Different countries have different traditions and
        different needs and rules for making content accessible, and some
        languages may be harder to deal with than others. For example,
        Japanese text-to-speech systems may need extra information compared
        to, say, English ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HCG/">Hypertext Coordination Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The Working Group will work with the HCG as the need arises.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/2001/tag/">TAG</a></dt>
  <dd>The Technical Architecture Group is responsible for the principles of
    Web Architecture. The I18N  WG will coordinate architectural issues
    related to internationalization with the TAG where necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Liaisons</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>IETF</dt>
    <dd>IETF working groups and other IETF activities that define technology
      with impact on Web Internationalization, such as the IRI WG and the work related to language tags.</dd>
  <dt>Unicode Technical Committee
  (UTC)</dt>
    <dd>A liaison has been established.</dd>
    <dt>Ecma TC 39 (ECMAScript)</dt>
      <dd> We will work with Ecma TC 39 on the development of the new EcmaScript Internationalization API Specification standard and the internationalization of the EcmaScript Language Specification (ECMA-262). The EcmaScript standard defines the core of the JavaScript programming language.</dd>
    <dt>Supra-national and national standards bodies</dt>
    <dd>The work of bodies such as ISO, ISO/IEC JTC1, JIS, and CEN, at
      the appropriate level (working group, subcommittee, technical
      committee,...), especially in so far as they work on general standards
      relevant to the internationalization of W3C technology or on national
      profiles of W3C specifications. Informal or formal contacts will be used
      as appropriate. The main groups, and corresponding areas for liaison,
      currently are: 
      <ul>
        <li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 (character encoding, sorting): A formal liaison
          has been approved to track the evolution of ISO/IEC 10646 and to
          input W3C requirements.</li>
        <li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG20 (characters in identifiers): A formal
          liaison has been approved to track developments and to input W3C
          requirements. The work program of this WG has recently been reduced
          considerably, and so this liaison may expire naturally.</li>
        <li>ISO TC 37 and  the language resources community in general (e.g.ELRA), since corpora exchange is key to the language technoloiges needed for the multilingual web, and there is strong trend emerging for language resource sharing to take a semantic web/ RDF based approach</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>Localization Industry Standards</dt>
    <dd>The WG will work with the Localization industry, in
      particular <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/">OASIS
      XLIFF</a> to ensure
      representation of the needs of these communities in the work of the
    WG.</dd>
  <dt>Conference and publication organizers</dt>
    <dd>The WG will maintain contacts with the major conference providers in
      the internationalization and localization fields, and will seek to place
      articles in publications in this area.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">www-international@w3.org</a>. This is the Internationalization Interest Group list, and is writable by list subscribers (the Interest Group). There are a number of additional,  specialized mailing lists under the umbrella of the Interest Group (eg. a bidi list, a CJK list, and an Indic list), which will also be used as appropriate for discussion. These lists are all tracked by the Internationalization tracker.</p>
<p>There is another mailing list, <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-core/">public-i18n-core@w3.org</a>, which can be used for discussions within the group, where needed. This is a publicly archived list, writeable only by Group members.</p>

<p>The Member-confidential list <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-i18n-core/">member-i18n-core@w3.org</a>
can be used for administrative purposes and for discussion of any
member-confidential aspects of specification reviews and liaison activities.</p>
