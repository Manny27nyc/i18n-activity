  <section id="h_gap_analysis">
  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="xxxx">XXXX Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for XXX on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

  <section id="h_info_requests">
  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
  <h2>XXXX Script Overview</h2>
    <p>This section introduces the XXXX script in general terms, providing some context and terminology that is useful in the remainder of the document. If possible, it's best not to introduce actual requirements in this section, but to leave those and detailed descriptions of expected typography to the sections that follow.</p>
    <p class="prompt">Is the script an alphabet, abugida, abjad, syllabary, etc? What are the basic set of characters for major languages written in the script? How does the script work? Are glyphs in the script regularly joined up, as in Arabic, or not? Are there other special features, such as stacking, syllabic clusters and conjuncts, etc. Is there a set of characters used for special purposes, such as transcription? Are multiple scripts used? </p>
    <p class="prompt">What are the basic directional features of the script? Is the script written right-to-left, or bidirectionally? Is is written vertically? If so, can it also be written horizontally, what is the frequency with which it is written one way or the other, and which side is the first line on?</p>
    <p class="prompt">Are there special considerations about page layout that should be described briefly at this point, eg. Japanese kihon-hanmen?</p>
  </section>

  <section id="h_characters_and_phrases">
    <h2>Characters and phrases</h2>
    <p class="prompt">The following is placeholder text, aimed to give suggestions for content. The questions are only prompts, to help the editor think of topics to address.

    <section id="h_fonts">
      <h3>Fonts and font styles</h3>
      <p class="prompt">What are key fonts and or font styles used for this script? Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? Are there standard fallback fonts in use in browsers, and if so do they match expectations? Does the script use fixed-width font glyphs, proportionally-spaced fonts, or a combination? <a href="index#fonts">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afonts%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
    </section>



<section id="h_glyphs">
    <h3>Glyph control</h3>
    <p class="prompt">Does the script in question require additional features to support alterations to the position or shape of glyphs, for example adjusting the distance between the base text and diacritics, or changing the glyphs used in a systematic way?  <a href="../index#glyphs_diacritics">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aglyphs-diacritics%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

  </section>
    

    <section id="h_punctuation">
      <h3>Punctuation</h3>

      <h3>Numbers, dates, etc.</h3>
      <p class="prompt">Does the script have its own set of number digits? How are they used, and how frequently? Does the numbering system use base-10, or some other type of base? Does it have special formatting patterns (eg. 12,34,000 in India). What about date/time formats and selection – are non-Gregorian calendars used? How are percent signs used, and do numbers have special decorations (like in Ethiopic or Syriac)?</p>
    </section>

    <section id="h_segmentation">

      <p class="prompt">What are the basic units of the text, and how are they demarcated, eg. characters, character sequences, syllables, or words?

    <section id="h_inline_spacing">
      <h3>Inter-character spacing</h3>
      <p class="prompt">Some scripts create emphasis or other effects by spacing out the letters or syllables in a word.

Are there requirements for this script that we should add? <span class="status_prompt"> (For justification related spacing, see below.)</span> See <a href="index#letter_spacing">available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainline-spacing%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="h_text_decoration">
      <h3>Text decoration</h3>
      <p class="prompt">Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations.

    </section>

    <section id="h_emphasis">
      <h3>Emphasis &amp; highlighting</h3>

If this applies to this script/language, how is it done? <a href="index#emphasis">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aemphasis%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

      <p class="prompt"> Is it normal to have flush lines down both sides of the text body (ie. full justification)? If so, what rules are used by the script to resolve the positioning of characters on a line? Does the script conform to a grid pattern? 
        Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? <a href="index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
