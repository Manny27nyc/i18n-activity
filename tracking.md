This file contains a list of GitHub repos currently being tracked by the i18n WG. All these repos should have the labels `i18n-comment` and `i18n-tracking`. When an issue with one of those labels is created, closed or a comment added, the i18n WG and IG will be notified in a daily and weekly digest. 

If your repo is in the list, you can bring issues to the attention of the i18n WG by adding an `i18n-tracking` label to it.

If your repo is not in the list, contact r12a@w3.org if you want your repo to be tracked.
